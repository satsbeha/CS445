# Exercise 
 write a paper about how JS engine optimize JavaScript code.

 In JavaScript programs, itâ€™s common to have multiple objects with the same property keys. Such objects have the same shape.this help JS engine to optimize JavaScript code.
 eg const object1 = { x: 1, y: 2 };
const object2 = { x: 3, y: 4 };
`object1` and `object2` have the same shape.
The objects have the same keys with no differences.we call this Monomorphism
